# Shorty
> .. enter a link and let the magic begin!

## About

Shorty is a simple url shortener for iOS, iPadOS and macOS.
This is my final project presented at Udacity to achieve the iOS Developer Nanodegree.

By entering the address of the website to be shortened, the user can save an unlimited number of ready-to-use shortened links.
